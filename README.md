# D3 maps Presentation

This is the code for my presentation on maping with d3 at the Utah d3 meetup October 14, 2015. The maps show reported UFO sightings in the US from 1920 up to 2015. All data comes from the [National UFO Reporting Center](http://www.nuforc.org/).

## Run the Code

Clone the repo, and run `npm install` to pull in dependencies. Then start up your favorite local server. I use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`.

Enjoy! And remember, the truth is out there.
